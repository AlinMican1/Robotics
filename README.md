# Robotics
The main class of this code is the Navigator_Robot class.
The objective of this robot is to go around a warehouse assorting boxes by their colour by delivering each different colour box to their designated waypoint.
It does this by having serveral different sensors, such as: infrared senors for detecting colour,  ultrasonic sensor where it emits a beam to measure the distance of how far an object is.
In addition the robot also has motors such as: the large motors, these are the motors our wheels use to spin them around and the medium motor which is a similar motor to that of the large motor, its function is the same having a spinning sensor inside detecting how far a motor has turned, used for picking up objects.
